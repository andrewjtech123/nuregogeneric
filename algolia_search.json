"body": "## Overview This site provides documentation, training, and other notes for the Jekyll Documentation theme. There's a lot of information about how to do a variety of things here, and it's not all unique to this theme. But by and large, understanding how to do things in Jekyll depends on how your theme is coded. As a result, these additional details are provided.The instructions here are geared towards technical writers working on documentation. You may have a team of one or more technical writers working on documentation for multiple projects. You can use this same theme to author all of your documentation for each of your products. The theme is set up to push out documentation for multiple projects all from the same source. You can also share content across projects.## Survey of featuresSome of the more prominent features of this theme include the following:* Bootstrap framework* Sidebar for table of contents* Top navigation bar with drop-down menus* PDF generation (through Prince XML utility)* Build scripts to automate the workflow* Notes, tips, and warning information notes* A nifty system for creating links to different pages* Tags for alternative nativation* Content sharing across projects* Emphasis on pages, not posts* Relative (rather than absolute) link structure, so you can push the outputs anywhere and easily view themI'm using this theme for my documentation projects, building about 20 different outputs for various products, versions, languages, and audiences from the same set of files. This single sourcing requirement has influenced how I constructed this theme.For more discussion about the available features, see {{site.data.mydoc.mydoc_urls.mydoc_supported_features.link}}.## Getting startedTo get started, see these three topics:1. {{site.data.mydoc.mydoc_urls.mydoc_getting_started.link}}2. {{site.data.mydoc.mydoc_urls.mydoc_configuration_settings.link}}3. {{site.data.mydoc.mydoc_urls.mydoc_adding_new_projects.link}}## PDF Download Option for Help MaterialIf you would like to download this help file as a PDF, you can do so here.

By displaying key SaaS metrics such as ARPU, Churn, and Revenue, in a simple and user-friendly manner, Nurego offers a powerful change management tool for your subscriber base.### Subscriber segmentation:Nurego gives you the power to fine tune your company's subscription plans by segmenting subscribers. Managing segments gives you the ability to optimize your company's business by adjusting price plans and trying out new products on a per-segment basis. This enables trial-runs and incremental rollouts of business changes, to optimize results and avoid negative impacts to the existing subscriber base.### Live and Test ModeEach Nurego account includes both a live and test instance. Your test instance enables you to conduct a complete test cycle for an entire backend system (customer website, billing, communications and deployment) without negatively impacting your existing customer base.```javascriptvar s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\";alert(s);``````pythons = \"Python syntax highlighting\"print s``````No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.But let's throw in a tag.```![alt text](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/hmBUEoKoTmaT9e7hcPnw \"Logo Title Text 1\")You can insert an alert by using any of the following code.The following demonstrate the formatting associated with each alert.{{site.data.alerts.tip}} Tutorial Requirement: You must have Plans and customers, in order to use this tutorial. {{site.data.alerts.end}}[Link to Nurego Java]({{site.data.nurego.nurego_urls.nurego_java.url}})    java    ruby    php      java    ```javascript    var s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\";    alert(s);    ```    ruby    ```javascript    var s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\";    alert(s);    ```    php    ```javascript    var s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\";    alert(s);    ```"
